                    Each firearm has a headshot multiplier of 900, but Zappers have damage resistance to firearms (with some exceptions).

                            Designed for the British Royal Horse Artillery, the Horse Artillery Pistol is
                            a unique pistol with an attacheable stock and enlongated barrel, akin to that of a carbine, 
                            the notable difference is that it is fitted with two barrels and locks, allowing it to fire 
                            off two shots, quick reload after firing one shot. But suffers from an uncancelable and long reload
                            if both shots are fired.
                            Alternative weapon for the line infantry class, less accuracy and shot power; no bayonet.

                            but has a quicker reload and is even less accurate and powerful, if used properly, can be considered
                            a direct upgrade to the officer's pistol.

                        These weapons function like shotguns, firing multiple smaller shots and scattering them using spread, high combined power, 
                        but lower damage and penetration per individual shot, making them a powerful horde clearer.
                        These weapons are even more effective in tight funnels or passageways, as shots are almost guaranteed to land 
                        despite the varying spread of each weapon.

                            Obtaineable for free for the seaman class, can easily wipe hordes or zombies

                            Designed by Henry Nock for the Royal Navy, the Nock Gun is
                            a combination of multi and spread shot traits, the Nock Gun has the highest damage per 
                            individual shot, with 7 barrels, it suffers from a long reload (if reloading all the barrels). However, the reload can be canceled after 
                            an individual shot is rammed down the bore by clicking, saving the shots. 
                            The Nock Gun has carbine accuracy, but can easily eradicate hordes at any range, takes a high amount of effort to learn.
